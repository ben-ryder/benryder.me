Conqueror of Empires is a turn-based strategy game where up to 4 local players battle to be victorious, by expanding their empires, and controlling units to conquer cities and attack the enemy.

The game was inspired by [Polytopia](http://midjiwan.com/polytopia.html) and [Civilisation](https://civilization.com/) and was made using python and pygame.

You can find the source code on my [GitHub](https://github.com/ben-ryder/Conqueror-of-Empires) or you can download it from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/ben-ryder/Conqueror-of-Empires/releases).
