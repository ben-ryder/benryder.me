This offers an easier way to interact with cloud storage from the command line and is especially suited to archival storage where you only need to update files occasionally.\n\nIt is published on PyPi here: https://pypi.org/project/rcl/.\n\n## Example Usage\n\nThis project is designed to be used as a wrapper around rclone, so initial setup of remotes still has to be done through rclone.\nOnce you have setup a remote (for example called `gdrive`) you can do things like...\n\n```bash\n# Add a new local/remote pair called \"music\"\nrcl add music /home/user/Music gdrive:Music\n\n# View the difference between the local and remote folder\nrcl diff music\n\n# Push local changes to the remote.
