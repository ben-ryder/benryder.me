Jigsaw aims to provide universal styling and reusable components that I can use to speed up developing my websites and applications.
While I could use existing component libraries, developing my own gives me the opportunity to customise everything while also giving me the space to practise writing CSS, using Storybook, applying atomic design, using accessible component patterns etc.

You can explore the design system and all the components using the live Storybook instance: https://jigsaw.benryder.dev.
