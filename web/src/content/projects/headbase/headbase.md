The way each person wants to organise their content is unique, personal and often use-case specific. Headbase gives you the building blocks to create content databases by defining content types, creating content items and then filtering and displaying those items using views like a list, kanban board, calendar, infinite canvas and more.

Headbase is not just a "notes app" or a "task management" app. It is what you decide to build.    

This project is early in development and is not in a complete or stable MVP release state yet.
