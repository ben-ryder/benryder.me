## Privacy Policy
When using this website I do not track you or gather any information that you do not explicitly supply to me.  
I use [hCaptcha](https://www.hcaptcha.com/) on my contact page though, which has its own [Privacy Policy](https://www.hcaptcha.com/privacy) and [Terms of Service](https://www.hcaptcha.com/terms).

### Contact Form
When you use the form on my [Contact page](/contact) I will (obviously) collect and store the information you provide.
The personal data I ask for is your *Name* and *Email Address*:
- **Name**:  I ask for this only so I have some way to address you. You're welcome to put anything you want.
- **Email**: I ask for this so that I have a way to reply to your message. I may need to answer a question you have, follow up on something you've said or just thank you for getting in touch.

The data you submit is stored securely and is not shared with anybody else.

## Cookie Policy
This site does not store any data on your device with cookies or any other storage system such as local or session storage.
I do use hCaptcha which may set its own cookies or use other storage mechanisms, see the hCaptcha privacy and terms pages linked above.
