# ðŸ§  Skills and Experience

This is a brief and honest summary of my skills and experience, which hopefully strikes the balance of being informative without becoming a random soup of tool names without context.  
At the end of the day, getting too bogged down in specific libraries and tools as a developer is like a mechanic tying their experience to a specific hammer they use after all!

- **Languages**: I'm currently most interested in full-stack Javascript/Typescript, however I want to experiment with languages like Go & Rust at some point. I've used PHP when building with Drupal, and some Python and Java in the past.
- **Front-End Frameworks**: Most of my experience is in React (Next.js, Gatsby etc), however I've played with Svelte and Solid a little and want to continue looking at simpler and more native alternatives to React.
- **Accessibility** - 
- **Web APIs**: I like to think I'm quite good with standard web APIs, and my interest in local-first software has exposed me to lots of things such as WASM, OPFS, WebCrypto, WebLocks, BroadcastChannel, WebSockets and more!
- **CSS and Styling**: I'm most experienced with BEM-based SASS and Tailwind. I've experimented with a few CSS-in-JS libraries though, and recently prefer using CSS modules and/or just Vanilla CSS where possible with libraries like LightningCSS/PostCSS for supporting draft specs.
- **Transitions and Animations**: I've done my fair share of implementing animations/transitions work and used libraries like motion, but I do consider this one of my weaker areas right now.
- **Back-End Services**: I'm yet to experience building back-end services at a company (apart from via a CMS like Drupal), but I've built quite a few Node.js APIs for my own projects and do run services "in production" for myself.
This has included implementing unit & end-to end testing, using tools like Redis and building my own authentication/authorization system.
- **CMS**: I have most experience building with Drupal, although I'm probably stronger with the front-end and site building aspects of Drupal than the back-end. I've also used Contentful and Wordpress a little.
- **Databases**: I'm no database administrator, but as part of building with Drupal and creating my own back-end services I've used Postgres, MySQL & MongoDB and have done migrations, query optimizations etc.
- **Testing**: 
- **CI and DevOps**: I consider this one of my weaker areas, but I have built GitHub Actions, published NPM packages, distributed Docker containers and self-host my own production services and a home server. My experience daily-driving linux for years often really helps here too.
- **Code Architecture**:
