# Licenses

## Source Code
The source code for this site is released [on my GitHub](https://github.com/ben-ryder/benryder.me) under the [AGPL-3.0 License](https://github.com/ben-ryder/benryder.me/blob/main/LICENSE.txt).  
If you use any code from this project, I'd highly appreciate a credit if you can.

## Content

### Projects
All my projects have their own license associated with them:
- Where the repository is on my [GitHub](https://github.com/ben-ryder), you will find the license in the repository there and most likely displayed by GitHub too.
- Where the source code is available but no license is given, let me know! It's probably my mistake and should be under an open source license. Until I confirm though, it's still supplied with [no license](https://choosealicense.com/no-permission/).
- Where the source code is not available and no license is given, the project is not open source and is under my copyright.

### Blog posts and Guides
All blog posts and guides on my website are published with the intention of offering help and sharing my knowledge. As such you can use anything (**such as code snippets**) freely within your own work, although I would highly appreciate a credit if you feel like giving it.

If you want to reference anything in your own work that isn't a code snippet or directly posed as a tutorial or walk-through then you should credit me.
You do not have permission to republish my articles on any other site/service claiming them as your own or by crediting me.
