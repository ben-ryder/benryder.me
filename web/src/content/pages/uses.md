# üõ†Ô∏è Uses
If you want to know what hardware and software I use, you've come to the right place.  
To learn more about `/uses` pages you can go to [https://uses.tech/](https://uses.tech/)

## General Devices
- **Laptop:** [Framework 13 Laptop](https://frame.work/gb/en/products/laptop-diy-13-gen-amd?q=processor)
- **Phone:** [Fairphone 4](https://shop.fairphone.com/fairphone-4)
- **Desktop:** Custom build including Ryzen 7 7700x, 32GB DDR5 RAM, Radeon RX 6800 XT, ASUS ProArt X670E-Creator, Fractal North Chalk White.
- **Desktop Keyboard**: [Keychron Q1](https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-q1) with [Glorious Pandas](https://www.gloriousgaming.com/products/glorious-panda-mechanical-switches?variant=37691905933487).

## Operating System and Software
- I dual-boot Windows & [Pop!_OS](https://pop.system76.com/). I use windows for gaming, audio recording & audio/music editing and use Linux for everything else.
- I disable lots of Pop!_OS specific desktop features and run a fairly vanilla GNOME. I don't currently publish any dotfiles, custom bash scripts etc as I feel like configuring a Linux distro is very opinionated. I may start writing some help articles for common Linux problems and suggestions at some point though.
- I use [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) and other JetBrains IDEs for development.

## Music and Audio
- For field recording, my main recording setup is a [Zoom F3](https://zoomcorp.com/en/us/field-recorders/field-recorders/f3/) with a [Mic Booster XLR kit](https://micbooster.com/clippy-and-pluggy-microphones/319-stereo-field-recording-kit-with-xlr-clippy-microphones.html), which includes a matched stereo pair of Clippy XLR EM272Z1 microphones. I also use the [Zoom H1e](https://zoomcorp.com/en/us/handheld-recorders/handheld-recorders/h1essential/) which is often more convenient for impromptu recording.
- I also sometimes use the Zoom F3 as an audio interface, but also use a [SSL 2+ Audio Interface](https://www.solidstatelogic.com/products/ssl-2-jm) when doing indoor music recording. I have the [Audio Technica MB2k microphone](https://www.audio-technica.com/en-gb/mb2k) for recording things like my Cello and have a [Kawai digital piano](https://www.kawai.co.uk/products/digitalpianos/kdpseries/kdp120/) (not exact model) which I record for piano.
- I use the [Beyerdynamic DT 770 Pro](https://europe.beyerdynamic.com/dt-770-pro.html) headphones when recording, mixing and editing etc.

## Other
- I like [LEUCHTTURM1917](https://www.leuchtturm1917.co.uk/notebooks/) notebooks for writing, note taking, journaling etc.
- I like [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for digital note-taking, personal wikis etc but I'm hoping this may eventually be supplanted by my own project [Headbase](/projects/headbase).
