I'm a full-stack developer from Manchester (UK) currently working at [GAIN](https://www.thisisgain.com/) building with Drupal, Next.js and Storybook.  
I'm also exploring local-first software and malleable systems in my [Headbase](/projects/headbase) project and design systems in [Jigsaw](/projects/jigsaw).

I get up to all sorts of other things, such as playing the piano & cello, writing, hiking, cycling and field recording.  
If you want to learn more about me, I have some details about [my skills and experience](/skills-and-experience) and an ['uses' page](/uses) which might interest you. 
I also occasionally write [blog posts](/blog) where I reflect on random thoughts, and [guides](/guides) where I focus on technical content and useful tips, so keep an eye out for those!
