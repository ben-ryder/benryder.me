I'm a full-stack developer from Manchester (UK) with 5+ years experience in web development. This includes working with CMS's like Drupal & Wordpress, front-end tooling like React, Next.js & Storybook, 
and testing tools like Cypress & Jest.

I'm currently experimenting with local-first web apps in my [Headbase](/projects/headbase) project and building my own design system in [Jigsaw](/projects/jigsaw).

I get up to all sorts of other things too. I play the piano & cello and enjoy writing, hiking, camping and cycling. I've recently been getting into field recording too, so I may publish those recordings somewhere in the future.
