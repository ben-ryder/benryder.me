I'm a web developer interested in all things Javascript, and I'm currently experimenting with Local-first technologies in my project [Headbase](/projects/headbase) and design systems in [Jigsaw](/projects/jigsaw).

I play the piano, attempt the cello and enjoy writing, hiking and cycling. I've recently been getting into field recording too. I'm thinking about publishing field recordings, ambiences and maybe even original music at some point in the future, so keep an eye on this website for that!

If you're curious about the tools and software I use and recommend, I have a [/uses](/uses) page that might interest you.
